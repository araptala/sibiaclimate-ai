                Satellite Remote Sensing Technology (RST) has been used in many
                developing countries, including Iran for a few civil purposes,
                particularly meteorological forecasting. However, although Iran
                and many other developing countries are located in earthquake
                prone regions, still there is slight development in the use of
                this technology for seismic warning purposes. One of the main
                reasons behind this fact is the lack of knowledge in disaster
                management authorities with respect to RST. The slowness and
                inaccuracy of this technology, the complexity of earthquake
                phenomenon and its sequences, and finally the low resolution of
                satellite Remote Sensing (RS) images, and their long repeat
                period are among the other factors that constrain the use of
                this technique in earthquake disaster reduction.

                Nevertheless, the recent developments in RST and the potentials
                of this technology for serving the disaster mitigation
                activities support the thought of using it for early warning
                purposes. It should be noted that the early warning concept of
                earthquake is different from what is usually meant by it in
                other natural hazards. In fact, instead of using the RST for
                predicting the time of an earthquake occurrence, which is
                actually impossible, this technology can be used for earthquake
                disaster early warning, by providing the disaster management
                authorities with the reliable information about the extent of
                damage to buildings and facilities in stricken areas.

                In this article, the practicability and other relative
                scientific, technical, and economical issues of using satellite
                RST in developing countries for earthquake disaster early
                warning are discussed. Special attention is paid to Iran as a
                sample of developing countries, which is located in a
                seismically active region of the world and has disastrous
                experience of several catastrophic earthquakes in recent
                decades. At first, some selected publications on the use of RST
                in earthquake disaster reduction are shortly reviewed. Then,
                various possibilities for improvement, which can help the
                development of RST for seismic disaster early warning are
                briefly explained, and finally, selection of the proper RST, by
                considering the existing techniques and equipment and also the
                natural, cultural, and economical conditions of developing
                countries is addressed.

              <h3>
                A BRIEF REVIEW ON THE USE OF RST IN SEISMIC RISK MITIGATION
              </h3>
              <br />
              <br />

              <p class="lead">
                The use of RST for seismic risk mitigation purposes goes back to
                early 70s. One of the first related techniques that can be
                mentioned is “Side-Looking Radar Imagery” (Kedar and Hsu, 1972).
                In recent decade more attention has been paid to the use of RS
                for natural hazards mitigation, and it has been claimed that RS
                has a unique role in natural hazard assessment and mitigation
                (Wadge, 1994). Airborne and satellite RSTs are among the newly
                developed ones for gathering damage information (Yamazaki et
                al., 1998; Matsuoka and Yamazaki, 2000). In those studies,
                Yamazaki and his colleagues by using RS data obtained before and
                after the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake, have examined the
                accuracy of several RSTs from the viewpoint of detection for
                building damage.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                A similar damage detection study has been performed on the 1999
                Kocaeli, Turkey earthquake (Estrada et al., 2000) by using
                Landsat/TM images. Another similar study has been done with
                regard to 2001 Gujarat, India earthquake (Yusuf et al., 2002).
                The damage of 2001 Bhuj, India earthquake has been also studied
                in a multidisciplinary approach based on high resolution
                satellite imagery (Chiroiu et al., 2002). Their study provides a
                fast loss estimation method in terms of physical damage and
                human casualties. It has been claimed that the results could be
                very useful for the rescue teams deployed immediately after the
                catastrophe. Very recently in an MCEER publication a study has
                been reported entitled "Resilient Disaster Response: Using
                Remote Sensing Technologies for Post-Earthquake Damage
                Detection" (Eguchi et al., 2003). Eguchi and his colleagues have
                studied the damages induced by the 1999 Marmara (Kocaeli),
                Turkey earthquake. They have claimed that their proposed
                techniques can be effectively employed to determine the extent
                of damages in urban buildings. However, their results show that
                their techniques are basically useful for heavily damaged
                buildings rather than moderately or slightly damaged ones. This
                can be considered as a limitation in the use of their proposed
                techniques.

              <h3>SELECTION OF THE PROPER RST FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</h3>

              <br />

              <p class="lead">
                The advantages and limitations of the optical and Side Aperture
                Radar (SAR) sensing systems as the two main tools of RST have
                been given in Table 1.
              </p>

              <h5>
                Table 1. Comparison of optical and radar satellite imagery
                (After Eguchi et al., 2003)

              <img src="" alt="" />

              <br />

              <p class="lead">
                It has been observed that these two systems can be very
                effective for damage detection if they are employed together,
                and their results are combined. On the other hand, recent
                earthquakes in Turkey and India showed that the main cause of
                human casualty in developing countries due to earthquake is the
                collapsed buildings. Therefore, it is quite reasonable for
                developing countries to plan for the combined use of optical and
                SAR systems for building collapse detection. This will provide
                the emergency management authorities with the more reliable
                information on the casualties’ distribution, which is a key
                point in the success of disaster mitigation actions.

              <p class="lead">
                This study shows that using combination of optical and SAR
                systems for providing real time information on the extent of
                damages in different parts of stricken areas can be very
                effective in minimizing the future earthquake losses. Some
                improvements are necessary to make RST more effective for
                disaster early warning among which increasing the revisit
                frequency of optical system is the most desirable one.
                Fortunately, the trend on RST development is promising in this
                regard.

                    The early warning provided by climate scientists each year
                    enables governments throughout the region to discuss and
                    implement El Niño-related contingency plans. The aim of this
                    Report is to briefly review the impacts and challenges in
                    the seasonal variability of El Niño and La Niña on crop and
                    livestock production in Africa in 2023.
