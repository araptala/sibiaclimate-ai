                        The El-Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most important coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate 
                        variability on inter-annual time scale. Basically, the phenomenon is related to the quasi periodic redistribution of heat across 
                        tropical Pacific region that affects weather patterns on land. ENSO is characterized by a varying shift between a neutral phase 
                        and two extreme phases such as El Niño and La Niña. <em>The El Niño phase is marked by a deep layer of warm ocean water across the 
                        eastern and central equatorial Pacific region. La Niña related condition is opposed to those of El Niño a deep layer of cooler 
                        than average ocean temperatures across the east-central equatorial Pacific region. </em>Monthly and spatially Sea Surface Temperature 
                        anomaly (SSTA) and the index values of each month has been considered over the tropical Pacific region of 5°S - 5°N and 150°W - 90°W. 
                        If the SST index values are 0.5 or greater, between -0.5 and 0.5, and -0.5 or less for consecutive months over central and eastern and 
                        Pacific Ocean, ENSO phase is categorized as El Niño, Neutral, and La Niña, respectively.

                        <h3>CLIMATE FOR FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURE IN EAST AFRICA</h3>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity in Africa and much of East Africa. Major economic sectors in sub-Saharan 
                        Africa are highly vulnerable to climate change and climate variability, with huge economic impacts. Agriculture remains the economic 
                        mainstay of many countries in sub- Saharan Africa, employing about 60% of the workforce and contributing approximately 30% of gross 
                        domestic product (GDP). Climate change can occur through natural physical and chemical processes and through human activities. Global 
                        atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O have increased since 1750. Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aerosols, 
                        land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system; leading to climate change on the Earth. Global total annual 
                        anthropogenic GHG emissions have grown by 70% between 1970 and 2004. Application of suitable climate change adaptation and mitigation 
                        practices have played a great role in reducing the impacts of climate change on natural resources, crop production and food security. 
                        Climate change is expected to influence crop and livestock production, hydrologic balances, input supplies and other components of 
                        agricultural systems.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        In East Africa, the agricultural sector provides livelihoods to 80% of the population and contributes about 40% of the GDP. Consequently, 
                        climate change and variability and the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events such as floods and drought in the region are 
                        threatening the food production systems, livelihoods and food security of hundreds of millions of people. Therefore, El Nino has been the 
                        most important natural calamity causing crop loss, shortage of water, food and feed for animals, and human beings and livestock in 
                        Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, the first public report on El Nino was on August 5, 1997, experts from the NMA had interview on Ethiopian TV 
                        explaining the role of El Nino in drought. On the contrary, La Nina phenomena also affected agricultural production, food security causing 
                        death of human beings and livestock as a result of flooding and excess rainfall which can harm crop production. So, understanding the 
                        importance of El Nino in the Ethiopian climate and livelihood of the population; this work has been reviewed to assess some of 
                        all-inclusive scientific literatures on the impact of El Nino and la Nina on crop production in Africa, and to prospects climate 
                        adaptation strategies to confirm food security.

                        El Niño conditions are closely monitored by major meteorological institutes and forecasts are updated accordingly. The early warning 
                        provided by climate scientists each year enables governments throughout the region to discuss and implement El Niño-related contingency 
                        plans. The aim of this Report is to briefly review the impacts and challenges in the seasonal variability of El Niño and La Niña on crop 
                        and livestock production in Africa in 2023.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What IS El-Nino and La Nina in the Context of East Africa? </h4>

                        <p class="lead">
                        La Niña is a weather pattern that occurs in the Pacific Ocean. In this pattern, strong winds blow warm water at the ocean's surface from 
                        South America to Indonesia. As the warm water moves west, cold water from the deep rises to the surface near the coast of South America. 
                        During a La Niña period, the sea surface temperature across the eastern equatorial part of the central Pacific Ocean will be lower than 
                        normal by 3 to 5 °C (5.4 to 9 °F). La Niña is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years, as a result of variations in ocean 
                        temperatures in the equatorial band of the Pacific Ocean. And on this basis we predict there will be an event in 2023.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        El Niño is severe drought and associated food insecurity, flooding, rains, and temperature rises due to El Niño are causing a wide range 
                        of health problems, including disease outbreaks, malnutrition, heat stress and respiratory diseases. Both El Niño and La Niña, the two 
                        phases of ENSO, influence rainfall, floods, dynamics and their implications for agriculture and food security. As the (Figure 1) depicted 
                        that, El Niño is a local warming of surface waters that take place in the entire equatorial zone of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean 
                        of the Peruvian coast and which affects the atmospheric circulation worldwide. Therefore we urge Governments to prepare for the coming 
                        torrent.

                        El Niño of Southern Oscillation (ENSO); the Southern Oscillation is an East-West balancing movement of air masses between the Pacific and 
                        the Indo-Australian areas. It is associated (roughly synchronized) with typical wind patterns and El Niño, and measured by the Southern 
                        Oscillation Index (SOI). El Niño is the oceanic component, while the Southern Oscillation is the atmospheric one. This combination gives 
                        rise to the term ENSO (El Niño – Southern Oscillation). Although there is no perfect correlation between El Niño and the Southern 
                        Oscillation as regards minor variations, large negative values of the SOI are associated with warm events. Between the warm phase (El Niño) 
                        and cool phase (La Niña), scientists describe conditions as “ENSO neutral.” Neutral means that the temperatures, winds, convection (rising 
                        air), and rainfall across the tropical Pacific are near their long term averages (Figure 2).

                        The climate of East-Africa is warmer than it was 100 years ago and model-based predictions of future GHG induced climate change for the continent 
                        clearly suggest that this warming will continue and, in most scenarios, accelerate. Observational records show that during the 20th century the 
                        continent of Africa has been warming at a rate of about 0.05°C per decade with slightly larger warming in the June–November seasons than in 
                        December–May. By 2000, the five warmest years in East-Africa had all occurred since 1988, with 1988 and 1995 being the two warmest years. This 
                        rate of warming is not dissimilar to that experienced globally, and the periods of most rapid warming the 1910s to 1930s and the post-1970s 
                        occur simultaneously in Africa and the rest of the world. The long rains (March–May) are less variable, so inter-annual variability is related 
                        primarily to fluctuations in the short rains. These are also linked more closely to large-scale, as opposed to local, atmospheric and oceanic 
                        factors. Rainfall fluctuations show strong links to ENSO phenomenon, with rainfall tending to be above average during ENSO years. The importance 
                        of short rains for inter-annual variability is underscored in (Figure 4) which compares annual time series of rainfall for the region as a whole 
                        with the corresponding time series for four seasons. A visual comparison shows that the similarity is strongest with October–November rainfall.

                        <p class="lead">
                        The El-Niño-Southern Oscillation is the most important coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on inter-annual time 
                        scale and it will come in between mid and towards the end of 2023. The El Niño phase is marked by a deep layer of warm ocean water across the eastern 
                        and central equatorial Pacific region while, La Niña related condition is opposed to those of El Niño a deep layer of cooler than average ocean 
                        temperatures across the east-central equatorial Pacific region. Therefore as expected, El Nino will be the most important natural calamity causing crop 
                        loss, shortage of water, food and feed for animals, and human beings and livestock in Ethiopia. Furthermore, La Nina phenomena also affected agricultural 
                        production, food security causing death of human beings and livestock as a result of flooding and excess rainfall which can harm crop production. 
                        Ethiopia is among the most vulnerable countries in Africa due to its great reliance on climate sensitive industries, particularly agriculture.

                        <p class="lead">
                        The Central Rift Valley in Ethiopia is a closed river basin where poverty and natural resource degradation are firmly intertwined. In the northern rift 
                        valley, on July to October is the main rains come to the wet winds from the Indian and Atlantic oceans converging over the highlands. However, in the 
                        southern part of the valley, there is little rainfall between June and August and a secondary peak in September and October. As the results, the impacts 
                        of increased temperature from global warming and changes in rainfall patterns resulting from climate change are expected to reduce agricultural production 
                        and pressure on marginal land. Reduction of rainfall during El-Niño and La-Niño would create severe drought, leading to reduction of pasture and water 
                        availability that cannot support the livestock population, as a result of this phenomenon, the livestock population shows a decreasing trend. Moreover, 
                        in this review, more than half of the El-Niño and La-Nina events coincided with lower rainfall distribution and reducing livestock population and higher 
                        mortality and off-take rate of cattle and sheep over the area. Hence, declining of rainfall during this period has resulted in severe livestock reduction.
                        Cattle and sheep population was lower (P < 0.05) during most El-Niño and La-Niño events in the study area.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        The principal cause of drought in Ethiopia is asserted to be the fluctuation of the global atmospheric circulation, which is triggered by sea surface 
                        temperature, occurring according to ENSO events. ENSO episodes and other regional systems have impact on seasonal rainfall performance and rainfall 
                        variability over Ethiopia due to remote tele-connections system. Therefore, extreme flooding, drought, lack of potable water for livestock and domestic 
                        use, food insecurity and market imbalance are associated with El Niño and La Niña in Ethiopia. Drought following El Niño caused 50 to 90% crop failure, in 
                        the eastern parts of Ethiopia. Climate impacts on food production is the predominantly rain-fed agricultural system, rainfall is one of the main climatic 
                        determinants of food production in Ethiopia. Disaster risk reduction structure, social protection and safety nets offer critical platforms and vehicles for 
                        investing in risk management for the most vulnerable and should become a policy priority. Finally, warm sea surface temperature (El Niño) leads to reduction 
                        in the summer rains, while the cold phase (La Niña) has the opposite effect over the environmental condition. This is particularly true for the very poor, 
                        whose livelihood depends totally on rainfall as the sole source of moisture for crop or pasture growth. Climate risk management thereby increases resilience 
                        to short-term climate variability while increasing adaptive capacity to deal with the longer-term climate change.

                        <p class="lead">
                        El Niño is a natural climate phenomenon that occurs periodically and affects the global weather patterns. It is characterized by the warming of sea surface 
                        temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, which can lead to changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns and increase the likelihood of certain 
                        weather events. In East Africa, El Niño is often associated with decreased rainfall, which can have a significant impact on the region's agriculture, water 
                        resources, and food security.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        In recent years, the frequency and intensity of El Niño events have increased due to the effects of climate change. This has raised concerns about the 
                        potential for more severe and frequent droughts in East Africa in the future. In 2023, there is a possibility of El Niño conditions developing, which would 
                        have the potential to bring about significant impacts to the region.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        However, it is important to note that the exact timing, strength, and duration of El Niño events can be difficult to predict, and the impacts can vary greatly 
                        depending on the specific conditions in each area. In some cases, El Niño events may bring increased rainfall and flooding to certain regions, while in others, 
                        it may result in drought and decreased water availability.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        In East Africa, the impacts of El Niño can be felt most acutely in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, which rely heavily on agriculture and rainfall-fed 
                        water sources. Decreased rainfall during an El Niño event can lead to crop failures and food shortages, which can in turn increase food prices and exacerbate 
                        poverty and hunger in already vulnerable communities.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Water resources in the region can also be significantly impacted by El Niño events. Decreased rainfall can lead to lower water levels in lakes, rivers, and groundwater 
                        aquifers, which can make it more difficult for people to access clean water for drinking, cooking, and irrigation. This can have a ripple effect throughout the region, 
                        affecting not only agriculture, but also the health and livelihoods of millions of people.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        To prepare for the potential impacts of El Niño in 2023, it is important for governments, organizations, and communities in East Africa to take proactive steps to 
                        increase their resilience and adapt to the changing climate conditions. This may include investing in drought-resistant crops, improving water management and conservation 
                        practices, and strengthening early warning systems for droughts and other weather events.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        In conclusion, the possibility of an El Niño event in East Africa in 2023 is a serious concern given the region's dependence on rainfall and its vulnerability to the 
                        impacts of climate change. However, with proactive measures and increased preparedness, it is possible to mitigate the effects of El Niño and protect the food security, 
                        water resources, and livelihoods of the people in East Africa.
