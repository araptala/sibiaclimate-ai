                        Climate change is serious. The threat is immediate. There is no long-term planning horizon nor quick fix solution. It is one of 
                        those big, scary, multi-faceted societal problems that will require serious, coordinated vision and leadership to solve. This is 
                        not a problem we can wish away or hope that technology will somehow come to the rescue and save us. It won’t. 
                        Solving this issue will require a healthy dose of honest, realistic dialogue. Everyone has a role to play, and professional accountants are no exception. 
                        We need to understand the extent of this climate emergency and look ahead to what we can and must do, and how to do it. Economic growth and the stability 
                        of financial markets depend on it. But despite the inevitable economic stress and strain we will face, adapting to climate change will also usher in an era 
                        of great opportunity.

                        <p class="lead">Without question, human activity throughout the past century and more has led to the destruction of ecosystems on which we depend, and 
                        contributed to unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases in our environment. The results of these activities are a disrupted ecology: extreme weather, 
                        severe storms, floods, droughts and heat waves at a frequency and intensity never before seen during the span of human existence. Changing patterns of 
                        land use, rising sea levels, destruction of habitats, biodiversity loss, deforestation, soil degradation, plastic waste and air pollution combine with 
                        climate change to create food shortages, forced migration, social upheaval and conflict, and increased vulnerability to infectious disease. The World 
                        Health Organization estimates that in the next 20 years, climate change alone will lead globally to 250 000 additional deaths per year.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><em>Climate Change is Happening and Will Increasingly Affect the Poor</em></p>
                        <p class="lead">
                        Today, it is widely agreed by the scientific community that climate change is already a reality. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has 
                        concluded that human activities are altering our climate system and will continue to do so. Over the past century, surface temperatures have increased and 
                        associated impacts on physical and biological sys tems are increasingly being observed. Science tells us that climate change will bring about gradual changes, 
                        such as sea level rise, and shifts of climatic zones due to increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. Also, climate change is very likely 
                        to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms. While there is uncertainty in the projections with 
                        regard to the exact magnitude, rate, and regional patterns of climate change, its consequences will change the fate of many generations now and to come and 
                        particularly impact on the many poor if no appropriate measures are taken.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        The impacts of climate change, and the vulnerability of poor communities to climate change, vary greatly, but generally, climate change is superimposed on 
                        existing vulnerabilities. Climate change will further reduce access to drinking water, negatively affect the health of poor people, and will pose a real 
                        threat to food security in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In some areas where livelihood choices are limited, decreasing crop yields 
                        threaten famines, or where loss of landmass in coastal areas is anticipated, migration might be the only solution. The macroeconomic costs of the impacts 
                        of climate change are highly uncertain, but very likely have the potential to threaten development in many countries.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Therefore, the task ahead is to increase the adaptive capacity of affected poor communities and countries. The work lies ahead to teach everyone what we must 
                        do urgently in the coming years before we also become extinct (it’s possible)

                        <p class="lead">
                        Part 1 of this document examines how climate change is likely to affect the existing vulnerability of poor people to climate related impacts. According to the 
                        Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, developing countries are expected to suffer the most from the negative impacts of climate change. This is due to the economic 
                        importance of climate-sensitive sectors (for example, agriculture and fisheries) for these countries, and to their limited human, institutional, and financial 
                        capacity to anticipate and respond to the direct and indirect effects of climate change. In general, the vulnerability is highest for least developed countries in 
                        the tropical and subtropical areas. Hence, the countries with the fewest resources are likely to bear the greatest burden of climate change in terms of loss of life 
                        and relative effect on investment and the economy. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Many sectors providing basic livelihood services to the poor in developing countries are not able to cope even with today’s climate variability and stresses. Over 
                        96% of disaster-related deaths in recent years have taken place in developing countries. Often, extreme weather events set back the development process for decades. 
                        With fishing grounds depleting, and droughts, floods, and storms destroying entire annual harvests in affected areas, the El Niño phenomenon serves as a prime example 
                        of how climatic variability already affects vulnerable countries and people today. In many developing countries, climate change already increases stresses from climate 
                        variability and extremes and will do so increasingly in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Adaptation is Necessary</h2>

                        <p class="lead">In the view of the participating agencies, adaptation to climate change is a priority for ensuring the long-term effectiveness of our investment in 
                            poverty eradication and sustainable development.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                            Part 2 will examines lessons learned in reducing poverty while strengthening the capacity of those living in poverty to adapt to climate change. The findings 
                            support a conclusion of the IPCC that adaptation measures, if pursued in the sustainable development framework, can diminish the damage from future climate change 
                            and climate variability.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Through the decisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), work has been initiated to develop the adaptive capacity of poor people and 
                        the poorer countries (Least Developed Countries) to cope with the impacts of climate change. Yet, a stronger focus must be placed on poverty reduction and sustainable development. 
                        We believe that the development and environment community must ensure that adaptation is not treated as a standalone issue, but in the context of poverty reduction and the 
                        Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Many examples show that addressing poverty implies also preparing for climate variability and extremes. While climate change is only one of the many factors influencing poverty, 
                        immediate action should be taken to adapt to climate change impacts. We argue that many possible interventions have already been identified, and prompt action can be taken today.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Our combined experience suggests that the best way to address climate change impacts on the poor is by integrating adaptation measures into sustainable development and poverty 
                        reduction strategies. Only such a comprehensive approach, which provides options for poor people to reduce their vulnerability to current and future risks, will contribute towards 
                        achieving the MDGs and ensure that sustainable progress is made beyond 2015.</p>

                        <h2>Strengthening Adaptation Efforts</h2>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Many adaptation mechanisms will be strengthened by making progress in areas such as good governance, human resources, institutional structures, public finance, and natural resource 
                        management. Such progress builds the resilience of countries, communities, and households to all types of shocks, including climate change impacts. Strategies to cope with current 
                        cli- mate variability provide a good starting point for addressing adaptation needs in the context of poverty reduction. Learning from experience will help to prevent the underachievement 
                        of sustainable development efforts and avoid maladaptation.

                                on the way in which policies and institutions respond to the impact of climatic factors on the poor</li>
                            <li><em>First steps towards mainstreaming</em> climate issues into all national, sub-national, and sectoral planning processes, such as Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) or national strategies for 
                                sustainable development.</li>
                            <li><em>Encouraging</em> a ministry with a broad mandate, such as planning or finance, to be fully involved in mainstreaming adaptation, especially in countries where major climate impacts are expected.</li>
                            <li><em>Combining approaches</em> at the government and institutional level with bottom-up approaches rooted in regional, national, and local knowledge.</li>
                            <li><em>Empowerment of communities</em> so that they can participate in assessments and feed in their knowledge to provide useful climate-poverty information. They will also need full access to climate relevant information systems.</li>
                            <li><em>Vulnerability assessments </em>that fully address the different shades and causes of poverty.</li>
                            <li><em>Access to good quality information </em>about the impacts of climate change. This is key for effective poverty reduction strategies. Early warning systems and information distribution systems help to anticipate and prevent disasters.</li>
                            <li><em>Integration of impacts</em>into macroeconomic projections. The rate and pattern of economic growth is a critical element of poverty eradication, and climatic factors can have a powerful bearing on both. Integration will prevent climate 
                                change diverting limited resources into dis- aster relief and recovery activities and away from long-term development priorities. The national budget process should be the key process to identify climate change risks and to incorporate risk 
                                management so as to provide sufficient flexibility in the face of uncertainty. </li>
                            <li><em>Increasing the resilience of livelihoods and infrastructure</em>as a key components of an effective poverty reduction strategy. Similarly, effective adaptation strategies should build upon, and sustain, existing livelihoods and thus take 
                                into account existing knowledge and coping strategies of the poor. Traditional risk sharing mechanisms, such as asset pooling and kin- ship, could be complemented by micro-insurance approaches, and infrastructure design and investment, both 
                                for private and public use, should take into account the potential impacts of climate change.</li>

                        Part 3 makes specific recommendations for action in the areas of:
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Development and environment agencies need to ensure that their efforts support the main- streaming of climate issues into general sustainable development. This requires a sector-wide examination of existing programs as well as: a close look at existing 
                        disaster reduction and preparedness programs to make maximum use of their ability to assess and reduce current vulnerabilities; the development of tools and methodologies for planning in the face of risk; training and awareness raising of senior management 
                        and staff; and the improvement of institutional processes to address the vulnerability of the poor in development programs. Furthermore, checks must be built in to avoid any development activity that undermines the capacity of the poor to cope with climate 
                        variability and change.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        The UN Conventions on Climate, Biodiversity, and Desertification all provide opportunities for sustainable development and implementation of measures should be integrated in poverty reduction strategies. However, many developing countries are stretched 
                        by the need to service all these international processes, leaving little time for them to engage in domes- tic implementation and determining national environmental priorities. This conflict can be reduced by, for example, maximizing synergies in reporting 
                        and other requirements and by integrating implementation measures into general development strategies.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Reducing the vulnerability of those most at risk from the impacts of climate change and the process of mainstreaming adaptation into poverty reduction will require, in many cases, sub- stantial external financial resources. These resources would need to be 
                        provided through a number of channels, which would include: bilateral, multilateral, and non-governmental development assistance; the new funds created by the UNFCCC; and the Global Environ- ment Facility (GEF) as the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC.
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        Development assistance should aim to reorient current practices and remove barriers to “no regrets” adaptation interventions through the integration of climate risk management in development programs. This would also help to mainstream adaptation in national 
                        development planning and budgetary processes. Additional resources are required to assess and address climate risks in projects supported by development assistance, where climate-safe development implies extra costs over and above business-as-usual. Funding 
                        by the GEF and the new climate change funds further supports interventions that help to prepare for climate change adaptation, and help demonstrate adaptation interventions. The nature and scope of this latter support is dependent on the evolving guidance 
                        from the UNFCCC, but we do have to act NOW.

                        Our website, Sibia Global AI, discusses climate change. AI, a 
                        subfield of artificial intelligence, is concerned with creating 
                        computer algorithms and models that may be used to predict and 
                        mitigate the effects of climate change as well as evaluate and 
                        comprehend the effects of human activity on the environment.
