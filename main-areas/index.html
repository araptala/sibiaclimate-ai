                The effects of climate change are increasingly visible. Storms,
                droughts, fires, and flooding have become stronger and more
                frequent. Global ecosystems are changing, including the natural
                resources and agriculture on which humanity depends. The 2018
                intergovernmental report on climate change estimated that the
                world will face catastrophic consequences unless global
                <strong>green- house gas (GHG)</strong>
                emissions are eliminated within 30 years. Yet year after year,
                these emissions rise.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Addressing climate change involves mitigation (reducing
                emissions) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable
                consequences). Both are multifaceted issues. Mitigation of GHG
                emissions requires changes to electricity systems,
                transportation, buildings, industry, and land use. Adaptation
                requires planning for resilience and disaster management, given
                an understanding of climate and extreme events. Such a diversity
                of problems can be seen as an opportunity: there are many ways
                to have an impact.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                In recent years, <strong>machine learning (ML)</strong> has been
                recognized as a broadly powerful tool for technological
                progress. Despite the growth of movements applying ML and
                <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> to problems of
                societal and global good, there remains the need for a concerted
                effort to identify how these tools may best be applied to tackle
                climate change. Many ML practitioners wish to act, but are
                uncertain how. Therefore, it is certainly great a pleasure to
                journey in this World of Climate Change and Artificial
                Intelligence.

              <p class="lead">
                AI has been called the new electricity, given its potential to
                transform entire industries. Interestingly, electricity itself
                is one of the industries that AI is poised to transform. Many
                electricity systems are awash in data, and the industry has
                begun to envision next-generation systems (smart grids) driven
                by AI and ML.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Electricity systems are responsible for about a quarter of
                human-caused GHG emissions each year. Moreover, as buildings,
                transportation, and other sectors seek to replace GHG-emitting
                fuels (Section, demand for low-carbon electricity will grow. To
                reduce emissions from electricity systems, society must:

                  solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear) and phase out carbon-emitting
                  sources (such as coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels).

                  electricity infrastructure, since the transition to low-carbon
                  power will not happen overnight.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>

                ML can contribute on all fronts by informing the research,
                deployment, and operation of electricity system technologies.
                Such contributions include accelerating the development of clean
                energy technologies, improving forecasts of demand and clean
                energy, improving electricity system optimization, and enhancing
                system monitoring. These contributions require a variety of ML
                paradigms and techniques, as well as close collaborations with
                the electricity industry and other experts to integrate insights
                from operations research, electrical engineering, physics,

                TRANSPORTATION
              </h3>

              <p class="lead">
                Transportation systems form a complex web that is fundamental to
                an active and prosperous society. Globally, the transportation
                sector accounts for about a quarter of energy-related CO2
                emissions. In contrast to the electricity sector, however,
                transportation has not made significant progress to lower its
                CO2 emissions and much of the sector is regarded as hard to
                decarbonize. This is because of the high energy density of fuels
                required for many types of vehicles, which constrains low-carbon
                alternatives, and because transport policies directly impact
                end-users and are thus more likely to be controversial.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Passenger and freight transportation are each responsible for
                about half of transport GHG emissions. Both freight and
                passengers can travel by road, by rail, by water, or by air
                (referred to as <em>transport modes</em>). Different modes carry
                vastly different carbon emission intensities. At present, more
                than two-thirds of transportation emissions are from road
                travel, but air travel has the highest emission intensity and is
                responsible for an increasingly large share. Our role at Sibia
                Global is to try provide advise in the Global Transport Network
                so that there can be good impacts that do not contribute to GHG
                Emissions.

                BUILDINGS & CITIES
              </h3>

              <p class="lead">
                Buildings offer some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes
                to reducing GHG emissions. While the energy consumed in
                buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related
                emissions, a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and
                state-of-the-art strategies could reduce ems sions for existing
                buildings by up to 90%. It is possible today for buildings to
                consume almost no energy. Many of these energy efficiency
                measures actually result in overall cost savings and
                simultaneously yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for
                occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the
                services that buildings provide—and even while extending them to
                more people, as climate change will necessitate. For example,
                with the changing climate, more people will need access to air
                conditioning in regions where deadly heat waves will become
                common. Thus it becomes important to prioritize built
                environments that do not contribute to harmful Carbon Emissions
                practices.

                Industrial production, logistics, and building materials are
                leading causes of difficult-to-eliminate GHG emissions.
                Fortunately for ML researchers, the global industrial sector
                spends billions of dollars annually gathering data on factories
                and supply chains —aided by improvements in the cost and
                accessibility of sensors and other data-gathering mechanisms
                (such as QR codes and image recognition). The availability of
                large quantities of data, combined with affordable cloud- based
                storage and computing, indicates that industry may be an
                excellent place for ML to make a positive climate impact.

                In particular, ML can potentially reduce global emissions by
                helping to streamline supply chains, improve production quality,
                predict machine breakdowns, optimize heating and cooling
                systems, and prioritize the use of clean electricity over fossil
                fuels. However, it is worth noting that greater efficiency may
                increase the production of goods and thus GHG emissions (via
                rebound effects) unless industrial actors have sufficient
                incentives to reduce overall emissions. Our role will be to
                Rport new emerging technologies that are being used by Industry
                to Mitigate Climate Change

                FARMS & FORESTS
              </h3>

              <p class="lead">
                Farms Plants, microbes, and other organisms have been drawing
                CO2 from the atmosphere for millions of years. Most of this
                carbon is continually broken down and recirculated through the
                carbon cycle, and some is stored deep underground, e.g., as
                fossil fuels, but a large amount of carbon is sequestered in the
                biomass of trees, peat bogs, and soil. Our current economy
                encourages practices that are freeing much of this sequestered
                carbon through deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. On
                top of these effects, cattle and rice farming generate methane,
                a GHG far more potent than CO2 itself. Overall, land use by
                humans is estimated to be responsible for about a quarter of
                global GHG emissions (and this may be an underestimate. In
                addition to this direct release of carbon through human actions,
                the permafrost is now melting, peat bogs are drying, and forest
                fires are becoming more frequent as a consequence of climate
                change itself – all of which release yet more carbon.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                The large scale of this problem allows for a similar scale of
                positive impact. According to one estimate, about a third of GHG
                emissions reductions could come from better land management and
                agriculture. ML can play an important role in some of these
                areas. Precision agriculture could reduce carbon release from
                the soil and improve crop yield, which in turn could reduce the
                need for deforestation. Satellite images make it possible to
                estimate the amount of carbon sequestered in a given area of
                land, as well as track GHG emissions from it. ML can help
                monitor the health of forests and peat lands, predict the risk
                of fire, and contribute to sustainable forestry. These areas
                represent highly impactful applications, in particular, of
                sophisticated computer vision tools, though care must be taken
                in some cases to ensure that ML tools are used in ways aligned
                with De-carbonization.

                CLIMATE PREDICTION
              </h3>

              <p class="lead">
                For most people, extreme event prediction means the local
                weather forecast and a few days’ warning to stockpile food, go
                home, and lock the shutters. Weather forecasts are shorter-term
                than climate forecasts, but they produce abundant data. Weather
                models are optimized to track the rapid, chaotic changes of the
                atmosphere; since these changes are fast, tomorrow’s weather
                fore- cast is made and tested every day. Climate models, in
                contrast, are chaotic on short time scales, but their long-term
                trends are driven by slow, predictable changes of ocean, land,
                and ice. As a result, climate model output can only be tested
                against long-term observations (at the scale of years to
                decades). Intermediate time scales, of weeks to months, are
                exceptionally difficult to predict, although many argue that ML
                could bridge that gap by making good predictions on 4 - 6 week
                timescales. We think we can crack this and help for finer
                Climate Prediction Methods at Sibia in the future.

                SOLAR GEOENGINEERING
              </h3>

                Airships floating through the sky, spraying aerosols; robotic
                boats crisscrossing the ocean, firing vertical jets of spray;
                arrays of mirrors carefully positioned in space, micro-adjusted
                by remote control; these images seem like science fiction, but
                they are actually real proposals for solar radiation management,
                commonly called solar geoengineering. Solar geoengineering, much
                like the GHGs causing climate change, shifts the balance between
                how much heats the Earth absorbs and how much it releases. The
                difference is that it is done deliberately, and in the opposite
                direction. The most common umbrella strategy is to make the
                Earth more reflective, keeping heat out, though there are also
                methods of helping heat escape.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Solar geoengineering generally comes with a host of potential
                side effects and governance challenges. Moreover, unlike CO2
                removal, it cannot simply reverse the effects of climate change
                (average temperatures may return to pre-industrial levels, but
                location-specific climates still change), and also comes with
                the risk of termination shock (fast, catastrophic warming if
                humanity undertakes solar geoengineering but stops suddenly.
                Because of these and other issues, it is not within the scope of
                this article to evaluate or recommend any particular technique.
                How- ever, the potential for solar geoengineering to moderate
                some of the most catastrophic hazards of climate change is
                well-established, and it has received increasing attention in
                the wake of societal inaction on mitigation. Although argue that
                the “hardest and most important problems raised by solar
                geoengineering are non-technical,” there are still a number of
                important technical questions that ML may be able to help us
                study. This way we can begin how to understand the sun better
                and also assist us to record ways in which we can reduce intense
                heat waves that are caused by Climate Change.

              <p class="lead">
                Access to quality education is a key part of sustainable
                development, with significant benefits for climate and society
                at large. Education contributes to improving quality of life,
                helps individuals make informed decisions, and trains the next
                generation of innovators. Education is also para- mount in
                helping people across societies understand and address the
                causes and consequences of climate change and provides the
                skills and tools necessary for adapting to its impacts. For
                instance, education can both improve the resilience of
                communities, particularly in developing countries that will be
                disproportionately affected by climate change, and empower
                individuals, especially from developed countries, to adopt more
                sustainable lifestyles. As climate change itself may diminish
                educational outcomes for some populations, due to its negative
                effects on agricultural productivity and household income, this
                makes providing high-quality educational interventions globally
                all the more important.
